# Claymorphism

**Overview**: Claymorphism is a design trend characterized by soft, rounded shapes resembling clay or plasticine. It combines bright colors with subtle shading to give a playful, tactile feel.

**How to Achieve It**:

-   Use **soft shadows** both internally and externally to simulate the softness of clay.

-   Apply **rounded corners** liberally to all UI elements, including buttons, cards, and icons.

-   Use **bright, playful colors** to evoke a sense of fun and approachability.

**Implementation Tips**:

-   Shadows should be **blurry and soft** rather than sharp, giving the impression of squishy, malleable surfaces.

-   Combine **gradients** to create highlights that enhance the clay-like texture.

**Component Libraries**:

-   [Claymorphism CSS](https://claymorphism.com/) - A generator to help you create claymorphic CSS properties.

-   [Tailwind CSS Plugin for Claymorphism](https://github.com/inevitable/tailwindcss-claymorphism) - Helps implement clay-like elements easily.

**Visual Examples**:

-   **Image Suggestion**: Display buttons and icons with rounded edges and soft shadows that give a clay-like tactile impression.
